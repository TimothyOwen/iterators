<h1>Exercises</h1>  

<h2>Numbers</h2>  

1. Create a method that takes a number 10-99, and adds the two digits together for example 74 = 7 + 4 = 11.

2. Create a second method that when given the number 1-99 returns a String representation of this number, for example 1 = one, 11 = eleven, 21 = twenty-one.

3. Expand on the method you wrote in Numbers 2 to allow the input 1-999.

4. Expand the method you wrote in Numbers 2 to allow the input 1-9999.

<h2>Flowcharts</h2>  

1. Recreate the following flowchart as a project:

3. Create a method that can print out the numbers 1-10 10 times each.

4. If you have used a while()-loop at any point in these exercises, replace them with for()-loops. Remember you should use a for()-loop when you know when the iteration should end.

5. Create a method to print the numbers 1 to 10 as many times as the value of that number.  
For example; you will print 1 once, and 10 ten times.

<h2>Numbers Revisited</h2>  

1. Use a for()-loop to print the numbers 1-100 in words.
For example; 1 = one, 100 = one hundred.

<h2>Coins</h2>

Given a cost and an amount, work out the change given in specific coinage.
For example; the cost is £4.58 and the customer pays with a £20 note so as change they receive:

1 £10 note

1 £5 note

2 20p's

1 2p

<h2>String Manipulation</h2>
For this task you are to implement 4 methods that manipulate String objects. For all parts of this section you are only allowed to use the length(), substring(), and equals() methods. 
Avoid using arrays or any methods you have yet to be taught as this defeats the purpose of the exercise:

Method 1 - When given a String, count and return how many words there are in that String.  
Method 2 - When given a String, print out this String in a vertical fashion, each word on a different line.  
Method 3 - When given a String, print out this String in a vertical fashion in reverse order, each word on a different line.  
Method 4 - A find method, which takes 2 Strings; the first is message and the second is the String you want to find in the message. A boolean value should be returned to indicate whether or not the second String has been found in the message.
